# Project

The project is just a simple fun hobby project for learning about compiler design and programming languages at low level.

## About -

The language will be a compiled language with some different unorthodoxical rules.


## Building - 

You must have the `nob.h` header file for building this project. If you don't have it, you can get it [here](github.com/tsoding/nob.h)
or using wget -

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsoding/nob.h/refs/heads/main/nob.h
```
Clone the repo and compile `build.c` using any C compiler.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/architmishra-15/awlang.git
cd awlang
```

```bash
gcc build.c -o build
./build
```

It'll automatically start building everything.

# License
